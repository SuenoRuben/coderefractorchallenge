The first step taken was to change the div classes into sections to read more easily.

I then deleted the unnessery font-size on the p element since the default font is already 16px.

I then added added list-style-type: none into .header div ul li in order to have less command and have easy to read code.

Under each parent section I had tabbed the code in order to individualize each section and know whats under each section.

I deleted .hero width due to being an unnessery code.

In the .benefits on css I transfered over the color:#ffffff to the main parent tab to not have 3 of the same color code repeated in text. 

I then grouped .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost together since they had the same css styling and making it easier to read.

I also repeated the step above to 
    .benefit-lead h3, .benefit-brand h3, .benefit-cost h3

    .benefit-lead img, .benefit-brand img,  .benefit-cost img

    .search-engine-optimization h2, .online-reputation-management h2,  .social-media-marketing h2

    .search-engine-optimization img, .online-reputation-management img, .social-media-marketing img

    .search-engine-optimization, .social-media-marketing, .online-reputation-management
This had helped in order to read the code more and have them grouped together to not make as much of a clutter.

I moved some of the commands under .benefit to .content because they are in the section of content and grouping them into their parent tag.
    The ones that I moved over are
            .search-engine-optimization h2, .online-reputation-management h2,  .social-media-marketing h2

            .search-engine-optimization img, .online-reputation-management img, .social-media-marketing img

            .search-engine-optimization, .social-media-marketing, .online-reputation-management
